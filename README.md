# SSH-Key-Loader

Modified version of script found on https://ivrodriguez.com/saving-your-github-ssh-keys-in-a-usb-drive/ to support Linux out of the box and be more plug and play.  The largest change from the original script is that there is no need to add in your directory name to the script.

Future improvements:

Possibly add error checking for the hour parameter (i.e. check for integers) 

This is working currently in a Linux shell, will test on OS X later.
